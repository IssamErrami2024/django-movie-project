Q:1:
How would you design and implement content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms? 
What databases would you use for efficient storage and querying of user preferences and movie metadata? 
-------------

For content-based filtering:
Design: Create a model to represent movie metadata ( genres, actors, directors).
Implementation: Calculate similarities between movies based on metadata attributes.
Database: Use a NoSQL database like MongoDB for storing movie metadata efficiently.

For collaborative filtering:
Design: Create models for user preferences (ratings, likes, etc.) and movie interactions.
Implementation: Recommend movies based on user-item interactions or similarity between users.
Database: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL for storing user preferences and movie interactions 
for efficient querying.

2 - How would you optimize database performance for a social networking platform
 using Postgres, Neo4j, and Qdrant for structured, graph-based, and similarity search data?
--------------

To optimize database performance for a social networking platform using:
	->Postgres (Structured Data):
		Normalize schema and index frequently queried columns.
		Partition large tables and use connection pooling.
		Regularly vacuum and analyze tables for optimization.
	->Neo4j (Graph Data):
		Define node properties, create indexes, and optimize Cypher queries.
		Tune memory allocation and caching settings.
	->Qdrant (Similarity Search Data):
		Define vector representations and configure indexing strategies.
		Use nearest neighbor algorithms and optimize search queries.

3-Describe using Celery for asynchronous task processing in a Django application,
 ensuring reliability and fault tolerance, especially for tasks that may fail or need to be retried.
---------

->Install Celery using command : pip install Celery and configure it in Django settings with a message broker Redis.
->Define tasks in Django by creating decorated functions with @task or @shared_task.
->Handle task failures by setting retry mechanisms, timeouts, and max retries using Celery settings.
->Implement error handling in tasks to catch exceptions and handle retries or failure scenarios.
->Utilize task result backends to track task status, results, and errors for monitoring and debugging.
->Monitor Celery workers using tools like Flower for real-time monitoring and management.
->Ensure idempotent task design to handle retries without causing side effects or duplications.
->Implement task acknowledgment to ensure that tasks are processed and completed reliably.
->Configure Celery beat for periodic tasks scheduling if needed.
->Test task retries and failures scenarios to validate fault tolerance mechanisms.
